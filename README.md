# Local Bistro Site!
    This is a simple one page website for a small bistro.
    I wanted to create a contemporary site for a nameless local restuarant.

    For now this is only front end but I would eventually
    like to include a backend portion where I can utilize the contact form.

    The biggest challenge I faced doing this was finding out how to create a menu outside of the document so I can update it without hard coding it.

    My solution to this was to create a json file and a bunch of for loops to take the json file contents and convert it to normal text and place the items into a <li> tag and place them into 2 different menus that change depending on mobile of desktop view.

## languages used:
* html
* css3 + bootstrap 4
* javascript
## with help from these cdn's:
* google fonts
* font awesome

## Google maps API
I used this api to place a fake marker on the map

## Take a look!
