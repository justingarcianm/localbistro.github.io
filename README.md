# Local Bistro Site!
    This is a simple one page website for a small bistro.
    I wanted to create a contemporary site for a nameless local restuarant.

    For now this is only front end but I would eventually
    like to include a backend portion where I can utilize the contact form.

    I plan to replace the google map image with a directions API from google.

## languages used:
* html
* css3 + bootstrap 4
* javascript
## with help from these cdn's:
* google fonts
* font awesome

## Take a look!
